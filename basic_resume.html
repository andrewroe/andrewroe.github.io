    <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>Current activity, St Paul, Minnesota - December — 2017- present</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Updated my Mac to High Sierra. Then installed several software items; apache-tomcat-8.5.24, mysql-5.7.20-macos10.12-x86_64, svn - version 1.9.4 (r1740329), Jenkins  2.9.3, Homebrew 1.3.9 (git revision 3ed1), Jdk-9.0.1_osx-x64 (which provides J2EE), and IntelliJ 2017.3.2 IDEA (Java IDE).
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Created an SVN repository and added some files to it.
      Created some simple Java programs and ran them via command line.  
      I have added sub-dirs into my SVN repo for bash, bourne, Java, Javascript, Perl, Python, and Ruby. 
      I plan to add test apps or other scripts to the appropriate sub-locations within the SVN repository as they grow into something of value.
    </li> 
    
    <li>
      Part of my plan going forward is to eventually install git locally or access a git repo via AWS and capture scripts and apps into a git repository as well as SVN.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      In the process of installing and using various tools, I’ve needed to or decided to create user accounts for; Oracle, Atlassian (so as to create/access Jira projects, I had a corporate atlassian account in the past, but now need a personal login), and AWS, Amazon Web Services.
    </li>
      
    <li>
      Needed to spend some time with financial activities, which has prompted me to be reading up on tax law and tax preparation. This has been enlightening, but competes for time with the other activities mentioned above.
    </li>
  </ul>
