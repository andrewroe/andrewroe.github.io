     <p>
     This is the "To Do" page for my "dynamic resume".
     </p>
     <p>
     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li><a href="base.html">Dynamic Resume Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="settings.html">Viewer Settings</a></li>
       <li><a href="objectives.html">Objectives</a></li> 
       <li><a href="references.html">References</a></li>
       <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li> 
       <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
       <li><a href="todo.html">To Do</a></li> 
       <li><a href="diagnostics.html">Diagnosing Problems</a></li>
     </ul> 
     </p>

     This page is intended pretty much for my own tracking and prioritizing.
     But I guess it could be referenced by any reader who might want to check up on me : -).
     <h2>Highest Priority</h2> 
     <p>
      For now, just a list:
      <ul> 
       <li>Get this 1st cut "dynamic resume" which is basically just a rough plan put into place.</li> 
      </ul>   
     </p>
     <h2>Medium Priority</h2> 
     <p>
      List:
      <ul>
         <li>Go through the tutorials for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
         <li>Figure out where to purchase a security signing ticket or some such and then enable HTTPS on EC2 host.</li>
         <li>Continue with and wrap up AIOIC class. This is on-going through June.</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <h2>Low Priority</h2> 
     <p>
      List:
      <ul>
         <li>Better figure out how to use jsbin.com and perhaps after exporting this project in GitHub into a "gist" 
         so as to be able to quick check the html or JavaScript prior to check in to my Git repo.</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
