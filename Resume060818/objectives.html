     This is the "Objectives" page for my "dynamic resume".

     <p>
     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li><a href="base.html">Dynamic Resume Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="settings.html">Viewer Settings</a></li>
       <li><a href="objectives.html">Objectives</a></li> 
       <li><a href="references.html">References</a></li>
       <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li>

     Objectives

     <p>
     The goal of this web set of pages is two-fold:
     a) to provide a professional summary of who and where I'm at professionaly and 
     b) as a guide of what and how I am progressing toward being a more useful professional.

     <h1>
     Rosetta Stone
     </h1>
     <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> is an historical artiface that explains why I am believing that web apps are the future.
        The web is the "Rosetta Stone" of the current era. 
        Why do I say that?
        It seems clear to me that the Rosetta Stone:
        1) acted as a reference for important or one might say needed information,
        2) could be copied or replicated readily,
        3) required an accomplished "scribe" to produce in the first place.
     </p>
     <p>
        Today the "web" is:
        1) the reference for the masses,
        2) it's contents can be copied or replicated with an appropriate device,
        3) requires modern day "scribes" to produce.
     </p>
     <p>
        Via a PC, iPhone, ... a browser can access valuable information from the web.
        (It can also access non-valuable information, but that is another story).
        A browser user can not only look at web informqtion but can copy any portion of that information from the web.
        An information viewer or gatherer today does not use papyrus paper and charcoal to "make a copy" of what is view-able today,
        but the concept is the same. 
        The scribe employed by a king or pharaoh to produce the Rosetta Stone was a valuable person to that king/pharaoh. 
     </p>
     <p>
        A web page developer today provides a similar valuable service to the "kings" of today. But he/she can do more. 
        Today the "kings" of industry and government can not only have important information made available to the masses, but scribes of today (web page developers)
        can see who is viewing or copying information, make that information be formated on the fly for the viewer, etc.
        Using a PC, iPhone, ... a browser can access very valuable information from the web.
        (That user can also access non-valuable information, but that is another story).
        A browser user can not only look at web information but can copy any portion of that information from the web.
        An information viewer or gatherer today does not use papyrus paper and charcoal to "make a copy" of what is view-able,
        but the concept is the same. 
        The scribe employed by a king or pharaoh to produce the Rosetta Stone was a valuable person to that king/pharaoh.
        The web app developers of today are, at a minimum, equally valuble as those ancient scribes. 
        If one wants to be truely literate today, then they must be web page accomplished.
        There is no other game in town!
