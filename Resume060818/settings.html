     This is the "Settings" page. 
     This is where a browsing user will be able to select some options. 
     Things like whether "warnings" should be in a different color.
     Whether or not pictures or maybe someday videos should be provided. 
     There my be performance reasons not to.
     Maybe there will be some text width choices.

     Again a goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism or maybe for now just be able to return to "base" page.
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul>
       <li>Home page - this would send you back to the home "base" page.</li>
       <li>Settings page - this is where you are, so selecting would only force a refresh.</li>
       <li>Objective page - what is the objective of this web document.</li> 
       <li>References page - a set of links to valuable URLs, etc. or some such.</li>
       <li>Projects page - what activities are in progress or completed.</li>
       <li>About me page</li> 
       <li>To Do - Reminders to me of what I need to do and with some kind of priority aspect.</li>
       <li>Diagnosing Problems page - probably just explaintions of how to look at the metadata via browser or inspect logs.</li>
     </ul>
