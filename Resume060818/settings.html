     This is the "Settings" page. 
     This is where a browsing user will be able to select some options. 
     Things like whether "warnings" should be in a different color.
     Whether or not pictures or maybe someday videos should be provided. 
     There my be performance reasons not to.
     Maybe there will be some text width choices.

     Again a goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism or maybe for now just be able to return to "base" page.
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
