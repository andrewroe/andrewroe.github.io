     This is the "Base" page for my "dynamic resume".  (P.S. I like the period after the quote)

     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li>Settings page - used to modify a user's view or browsing experience.</li>
       <li>Objective page - what is the objective of this web document.</li> 
       <li>References page - a set of links to valuable URLs, etc. or some such.</li>
       <li>Projects page - what activities are in progress or completed.</li>
       <li>About me page</li> 
       <li>To Do - Reminders to me of what I need to do and with some kind of priority aspect.</li>
       <li>Diagnosing Problems page - probably just explaintions of how to look at the metadata via browser or inspect logs.</li>
     </ul>
