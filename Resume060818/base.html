     <h1>
       <b>&#934 * &#928 * &#928 = 16</b>
    </h1>  
     <p>
     This is the "Base" page for my "dynamic resume".
     </p>
     <p>
     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li><a href="base.html">Dynamic Resume Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="settings.html">Viewer Settings</a></li>
       <li><a href="objectives.html">Objectives</a></li> 
       <li><a href="references.html">References</a></li>
       <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li> 
       <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
       <li><a href="todo.html">To Do</a></li> 
       <li><a href="diagnostics.html">Diagnosing Problems</a></li>
     </ul> 
     </p> 
     <p>
     The above navigation will hopefully somehow move to another area of the display. 
     I'm hoping to the left side. 
     So really, this page doesn't have much purpose other then to be an introduction.
     <h1> Introduction</h1>
     You are viewing a different sort of resume.
     It is not like a traditional or what I would call static resume.
     It will serve as a common point for syncing what professionally you, the viewer, might want to know about me
     and also as a way for me to track what I am actively doing to become the professional you may want to employ.
     I will use this and subsequent related web pages to describe me professionally; 
     to articulate what I'm doing or trying to do.
     I don't want to hide either any successes nor struggles. 
     I believe that is the most helpful and honest approach for you and for me.
     </p>
     <p>Sincerely,</p>
