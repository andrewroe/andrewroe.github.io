     <p>
     This is the "Diagnostics" page for my "dynamic resume".
     </p>
     <p>
     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li><a href="base.html">Dynamic Resume Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="settings.html">Viewer Settings</a></li>
       <li><a href="objectives.html">Objectives</a></li> 
       <li><a href="references.html">References</a></li>
       <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li> 
       <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
       <li><a href="todo.html">To Do</a></li> 
       <li><a href="diagnostics.html">Diagnosing Problems</a></li>
     </ul> 
     </p>
     <h1>
     Diagnosing Problems
     </h1>
     <p>
     This page is intended as more of a self help for me or any reader who might want a quick reference for problem diagnosing.
     Diagnosing Problems can be in different catagories, so I'm going to create sub-sections for each catagory.
     <h2>Browsers</h2> 
     <p>
      On my Safari client one can view the actual source with "option+command+U" or use Develop->Show Page Source.
      On Windows I'm recalling that F12 is used. But I'll have to check that out later.
     </p>
        <h2>Log traces</h2> 
     <p>
      I'll fill this in later. 
      There are many ways/places for such and I'll try to come back and fill this in with more detail at a later time.
