     This is the "Projects" page for my "dynamic resume".
     </p>
     <p>
     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. The sub-pages haven't even been created yet. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li><a href="base.html">Dynamic Resume Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="settings.html">Viewer Settings</a></li>
       <li><a href="objectives.html">Objectives</a></li> 
       <li><a href="references.html">References</a></li>
       <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li> 
       <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
       <li><a href="todo.html">To Do</a></li> 
       <li><a href="diagnostics.html">Diagnosing Problems</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h1>

     <p>
     This section should ellicit activities or projects I am or have worked on that are pertinent to my goal of creating web pages.
     </p>
     <p>
     Below are listed a few things. 
     I'm hoping to only briefly describe each activity/project and then provide a link to more detail about each.
     That way this web doc doesn't get cluttered with project details.
        <ul>
           <li><a href="base.html">This resume</a> is really a project onto itself.</li>
           <li>An AWS EC2 "LAMP" host for Web hosting a demo or instruction tool of SQL usage. 
              This is as yet very vague on requirements. 
              So I only have a cloud virtual host created to experiment on. 
              I don't want to point to that host yet, because I haven't enabled it for secure access.
           </li>
