     This is the "About Me" page for my "dynamic resume".
     </p>
     <p>
     A goal is to have a "navigation" mechanism to all the other sub-pages of this web document. 
     For now I'm just going to list them with bullets. 
     Later it would be nice to have a "navigation" bar or some such on the left side of this page.
     <ul> 
       <li><a href="base.html">Dynamic Resume Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="settings.html">Viewer Settings</a></li>
       <li><a href="objectives.html">Objectives</a></li> 
       <li><a href="references.html">References</a></li>
       <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li> 
       <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
       <li><a href="todo.html">To Do</a></li> 
       <li><a href="diagnostics.html">Diagnosing Problems</a></li>

     About me
     </h1>
     <p>
        If a reader wants to view my static and text based resume they can go <a href="https://andrewroe.github.io/basic_resume.html">here.</a>.
        But it is probably more interesting to have a brief bio of me with a picture of me when I was young,
        which when taken is about my first memory. 
     Propobably a picture of me now - showing that some water has gone under the bridge. :-)
     Somehow the goal here is to possibly give a viewer a better sense of who I am.
     For now, let me just say:
     I like to ride bicycle.
     I like to play Bridge.
     I like music.
     Family is important to me.
