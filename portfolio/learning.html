						<!-- <h2>Skills</h2> -->
						<p> I believe that particularily in the computer world and maybe in life in general, constant learning is necessary. It should always be a goal, even if not specifically mentioned. As you can see from my picture, it can be a little more pleasant to learn new things then to slog through bugs. But even bugs can be a lot of fun once you've figured them out.
						</p>

						<p> I'm dividing my learning goals into 2 catagories; Languages and Tools. For each catagory I'm defining the skill level goal I want to achieve, on a scale of 1 - 100. I'm generally using a goal value of 10 to indicate "novice" level, a value of 25 would be "rookie" level, 50 would be "fair" or reasonably "competent", 75 is "accomplished" level, and a 100 would be "the best in the universe." Basically a 100 is what AI might become. Not what any human can expect to get to.
						</p>

						<p> Some of my learning goals have already been mentioned in my "skills" page. That is because, I believe I've achieved some level of skill with those. But I'm relisting them here, because they are skills that I want to learn to be better at.
