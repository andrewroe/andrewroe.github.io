      This page is deliberatly very simplistic for now, so that it serves as a quick sanity check of browser access.
    </p>   
    <p>This whole home page needs a lot of work. So let's get started. Today is 6/8/2018.
      The task at hand is to plan out a better enhanced resume, which I'm planning to refer to as a "dynamic resume."

      Below are links to varied HTML documents. Such as:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="basic_resume.html">Basic Resume</a> (This could use some more work.)</li>
      <li><a href="Resume060818/base.html">Dynamic Resume</a> (Starting to construct this document.)</li>
    </ul>
