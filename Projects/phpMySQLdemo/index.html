      Introduction
    </h1>  
    <p>
      This is where you start for learning about the phpMySQLdemo project.
    </p>   
      
    <h1>
      Project Planning
    </h1>  
    <p>
      The plan so far is taking shape as; 
      1) set up a web host for demo viewers (students), 
      2) refer to documentation as a guide,
      3) allocate an area in a repository for capturing code and documentation.
    
    <h2>
        Web Host
    </h2>
    An AWS EC2, cloud based, host was set up for this. 
    It can be accessed <a href="https://ec2-54-191-248-73.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com">at</a>.
    AGAIN! Let me emphasize, this has HTTPS enabled but the SSL/TSL certificate is expired and I haven't
    figured out yet how to update that at no cost.
    
    <h2>
        Reference Documentation
    </h2>
    In addition to what is available on the web, and there is lots of stuff, 
    I'm using as reference an old "PHP & MySQL for Dummies". 
    Once a basic demo is in place, perhaps there will be time to fancy it up.
    
        
    <h2>
        Repository
    </h2>
    Planning on using GitHub at this time.

    <h1>
      Implementation
    </h1>  
    <p>
      This section should provide implementation details that might be helpful to a viewer or me.
    </p>   
        
    <h1>
      Testing
    </h1>  
    <p>
      This section will document something about how to test this and also what testing was or is being done.
      I do have a free atlassian account, 
      which would probably be a great way to track problems found and progress made to fix them. 
    </p>   
        
    <h1>
      User Documentation
    </h1>  
    <p>
      This section will provide some basic instructions in order for a demo user to try out the phpMySQLdemo web page(s).
